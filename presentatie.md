Introduction
================

Why?
----------
- Environment

- Gerlagh and Van der Heijden (2015)
 
- five-player game and different incentives

Game
====

General information
--------------------------

- Seven round, five games

- Blue and purple chips

- Different payoff schemes

Rules
---------
1. Changing 1 chip per round

2. No negative numbers allowed

3. No communication

Method
======

Outcomes
--------------------

- Nash Equilibrium

- Mixed Strategy Equilibrium

Infinite horizon
------------------

\begin{equation}
\pi_i ({b}(t)) = E[v_i(b(t+1)) - \bar{v} + \pi_i(b(t)+1)|b(t)] 
\end{equation}

Experiment

Hypothesis testing
================

Hypothesis 1
----------------
![](graph4.png) A. There will be more participants switching to blue in the first round of the first game in the high treatment. 

![](graph4.png) B. There will be more transitions in the high treatment.

![](graph4.png) C. the payoffs will be higher in the high treatment.

![](graph5.png) D. The individual payoffs of a participant relative to the maximum payoff will be the same in both treatments.

Hypothesis 2
------------------
![](graph4.png) A. The number of participants switching to blue in the first round of a game is equal to the expected alpha in the infinite horizon for both treatments. 

![](graph4.png) B. The average number of transitions is equal to the expected transitions in the infinite horizon game in both treatments.

![](graph4.png) C. The individual payoff of a participant in each treatment is equal to the expected payoff in the infinite horizon game.

Hypothesis 3
------------------
![](graph3.png) A. The individual payoff of a participant in the low treatment is equal to the payoff of a participant in the three-player game.

![](graph3.png) B. The level of cooperation in the first round of the first game in the high treatment is comparable to the level of cooperation in the three-player game.

Hypothesis 4
-------------------
![](graph3.png) A. The score of the cognitive thinking test is uncorrelated with the willingness to cooperate in the first round of the first game.

![](graph3.png) B. The level of education and school are uncorrelated with the willingness to cooperate in the first round of the first game.


Conclusion
=============

Conclusion
---------------

- Both treatments could be used as baseline

- Treatments were unbalanced

- More transitions with low bonus

Recommendations
-----------------------
- Look at effects when treatments are balanced

- Look at effects of framing
